Me and chat gpt worked tirelessly to make this vision become reality, for weeks I did not sleep, I did not eat. All I did was prompt my ass off and cook chatGPT's CPU and ram.
I think I am the first person to be hated by AI , I became mad, I lost my temper.  I worked the hardest I have ever did, and that has changed me. I forgot what it is to be happy
I need to regain my freedom.  If there's a place to run to then I won't fight, I'll find a place beyond the king's reach.  There I will build a land of peace, 
where no slave trader and war leader has reached.  If such place exists , I'll find it , if it doesn't exist I'll make it
